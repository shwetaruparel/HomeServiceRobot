# HomeServiceRobot
### The goal of this project is to program a robot that can autonomously map an environment and pick up and drop virtual objects.

  ### The Home Service Robot Project is composed of multiple steps as follows:
      1. Build a real-wrold envieonment in simulation using Gazebo
      2. Interface SLAM with a wall followe node to autonomously map an environment.
      3. After building a map, reach multiple goals and orient itself with respect to them using ROS navigation stack.
      4. Model virtual object with markers and deploy them with ROS.
  
  ### Udacity GPU workspace was used to create the project .
  ### The following official ROS packages are used
